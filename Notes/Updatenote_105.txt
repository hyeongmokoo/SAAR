1.0.5 Update (09/28/2018)

Linear Regression tool
: Added an option to specify the alternative hypothesis for residual spatial autocorrelation, which must be one of greater (default), less or two sided.

GLM Tool
: Added an option to specify the alternative hypothesis for residual spatial autocorrelation, which must be one of greater (default) or less.
: Modified pseduo R squared calculation from Nagelkerke R squred to R squared value of linear regression between observed and fitted values

Spatial Autoregression
: Modified pseduo R squared calculation from Nagelkerke R squred to R squared value of linear regression between observed and fitted values

ESF Tool
: Added an option to specify the alternative hypothesis for residual spatial autocorrelation, which must be one of greater (default), less or two sided.
: Modified pseduo R squared calculation of GLM based ESF from Nagelkerke R squred to R squared value of linear regression between observed and fitted values

Spatially varying coefficients
: Modified the interface for an only-intercept model
: Added a non-intercept model option
